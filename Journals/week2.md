# Week 2

# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learnt about Static and Dynamic websites (issues, more complex and overhead). Static websites are generally easier to build, while dynamic websites are more complex, but more robust. According to [Static vs Dynamic websites: Pros and Cons](https://wsvincent.com/static-vs-dynamic-websites-pros-and-cons/)
* Static websites are: fast, cheap and simpler for a developer to setup. However, they require a developer to update content, and can get very bulky, since new files need to be created per content.
* Dynamic websites: easily generate content for each user or entity and integrate very easily with more powerful features like login and payments. These sites can be created from scratch or managed using templates, through a content management system.

Content Management System (CMS)
According to [What is a Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), a CMS is a computer application that allows publishing, editing, modifying, organizing, deleting, and maintaining content from a central interface. Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment, a bundled or stand-alone application to create, deploy, manage and store content on Web pages.

I also learnt about the top Content Management Systems, which according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/business/software/best-content-management-systems/) are:
* Wix: Best Overall
* WordPress.com: Best for Tight Budgets
* Drupal: Best for Enterprises
* Shopify: Best for E-Commerce Businesses
* Joomla: Best for New Developers
* TYPO3: Best for Extension Library
* WordPress.org: Best for Customisation

In terms of website traffic and market share, Wordpress is the most popular, as revealed by [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management) in this image below

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 7 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Saturday, I did about an hour of study. The following week, I spent 2 hours each, on Monday and Tuesday working on setting up my [start up joomla website](https://sfnstartup.cloudaccess.host/index.php) and also creating my journal. On Wednesday, I spent an hour completing this journal and on Thursday, I did more work on my site.

# Content Insights
This week's content exposed me to static and dynamic websites and the need for content management systems. Dynamic websites use an application running on their servers to process requests and deliver content specific to that request, e.g. showing a profile picture only for that user. These applications can be built using C#, Java or PHP. Alternatively, a Content Management System can be used as the application. Joomla was the CMS we were introduced to this week. Joomla has the option of downloading to your PC, or launching a site online.

We were also introduced to virtual environments such as Scotchbox/Vagrant. These environments help software develoipment teams to quickly setup projects with the correct configurations. Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments. Scotch Box on the other hand, is a pre-configured Vagrant Box with a full array of LAMP Stack features to get you up and running with Vagrant in no time.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Creating the Joomla website for my startup proved to be complex for me, as I had never done it before. I tried to set it up on my PC, by using the download option. to do this, I had to first download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and set it up on my PC. This was very insightful for me, because I learnt how to quickly set up mySql as a database and PHP as a backend technology at a go. However, installing Joomla proved to be very difficult. I then decided to try the launch version and create the site online. I was able to set up my C-Panel and these [videos](https://www.cloudaccess.net/joomla-knowledgebase/138-joomla-3-1/getting-started.html) really helped. I was able to edit the default template provided by Joomla C-Panel, create menus and articles. I also created modules and added media to my site. Overall, this process was really tidious and I intend to watch more videos and study more about it.

Finally, I looked at the Exploring No Code Solutions section of the LinkedIn Learning course on Introduction to web design and development course to see if I could get some extra help with my start-up website.
