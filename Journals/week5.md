# Week 5
Monday, 17-June-2024 to Saturday, 22-Jun-2024

# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learnt about child themes and their importance. Child themes are useful because they help to cusotmize the sites without losing access to the updates of the parent theme.

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Wednesday and Thursday of the following week, I spent 2 hours each day, working on:
* creating a child theme,
* creating my journal.

# Content Insights
This week's content introduced me to child themes and some of the ways to create child themes

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I looked at various options for child themes on Wordpress and I enjoyed creating a child theme for my WordPress site. On the Joomla end, it was a bit tricky and more complex.
