I also had discussions with my course mates and asked them the following questions, so as to form a group:
* What are your strengths?
* What are your weaknesses?
* What is your most frequesnt mode of communication?

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Saturday, I did about an hour of study. The following week, I spent 2 hours each, on Monday and Wednesday working on setting up my [start up wordpress website](https://wordpresssfnstartup.cloudaccess.host/) and also creating my journal. Also, on Wednesday, I spent time completing this journal.

# Content Insights ***
This week's content exposed me to static and dynamic websites and the need for content management systems. Dynamic websites use an application running on their servers to process requests and deliver content specific to that request, e.g. showing a profile picture only for that user. These applications can be built using C#, Java or PHP. Alternatively, a Content Management System can be used as the application. Joomla was the CMS we were introduced to this week. Joomla has the option of downloading to your PC, or launching a site online.

We were also introduced to virtual environments such as Scotchbox/Vagrant. These environments help software develoipment teams to quickly setup projects with the correct configurations. Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments. Scotch Box on the other hand, is a pre-configured Vagrant Box with a full array of LAMP Stack features to get you up and running with Vagrant in no time.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Creating the Wordpress website for my startup was new to me, as I had never done it before. After my experience last week with Joomla, I found this a bit easier to setup. However, editing the site seemed more complex than Joomal's. I started looking at the [LinkedIn Learning WordPress Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-essential-training-22616273/getting-started-with-wordpress?u=2223545) and it proved very helpful. Overall, this process was somewhat simple to setup, but a bit tidious to customize the site. I intend to watch more videos and study more about it.
