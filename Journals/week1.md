# Learning Activities & Resources 

*** This week I set up a student LinkedIn Learning account (Your In Progress Content | LinkedIn Learning) and studied a bit of the Introduction to web design and development course. I also set up an Azure student account to help with my web hosting (Education - Microsoft Azure). 

Learning Activities & Resources 

This week I setup a child theme based off the WordPress Twenty Twenty theme, and studied some of the LinkedIn Learning courses after finishing the practical to ensure that I learned everything that I needed to know about child themes, which I think may be useful for the group assignment.

Estimated Hours 

I spent about 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time I spent on the assignment. 

Content Insights 

Child themes were a good introduction to theme creation for WordPress, as it helped me understand the basics without jumping right into making my own theme from nothing. It was also a small step into PHP, which I'm feeling a bit more confident about after this week. I learned that variables are created with a $ in PHP, and that overall the language is somewhat similar to Java in general (which I have some decent experience with). 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights 

After completing the practical, I started to look at the LinkedIn Learning course on child themes to see if they gave any more insight that I did not obtain from the work I did in the practical. I did learn some things that I would not have learned otherwise, such as some of the more advanced CSS I did not learn in Web Design, which I think could be very useful in creating more minute detail in my websites in the future. From this strategy to learning this week, I have concluded that this approach to learning could be effective, but looking at guides, then doing some of the work, then going back to tutorials works better for me, as I discussed in an earlier week.
