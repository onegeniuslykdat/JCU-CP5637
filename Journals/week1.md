# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I set up a student LinkedIn Learning account [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me/my-library/in-progress?u=2223545](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me/my-library/in-progress?u=2223545) and studied a bit of the Introduction to web design and development course.

I also set up an Azure student account to help with my web hosting [https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=31779fb5-d4c5-4fe1-9cec-c0a1ccb5814b&Microsoft_Azure_Education_newA4E=true&Microsoft_Azure_Education_asoSubGuid=45add313-2d72-49ea-921a-6799e8668c79#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/overview](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=31779fb5-d4c5-4fe1-9cec-c0a1ccb5814b&Microsoft_Azure_Education_newA4E=true&Microsoft_Azure_Education_asoSubGuid=45add313-2d72-49ea-921a-6799e8668c79#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/overview). 

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject.

On Wednesday after the clas, I did about 2 more hours of extra study. While I spent 3 hours on Saturday on my start-up website [https://onegeniuslykdat.github.io/JCU-CP5637-Website/](https://onegeniuslykdat.github.io/JCU-CP5637-Website/) and journal.

# Content Insights
Creating the journal on github, using markdowns (.md files) were a very exciting learning process for me. I found the markdown file pretty cool to work with.

I also found using Github Pages to host static web pages very helpful.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I looked at the LinkedIn Learning course on Introduction to web design and development course to see if I could get some extra help with my start-up website.

I also did extra learning about markdowns on [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and learnt more about Github Pages on [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
